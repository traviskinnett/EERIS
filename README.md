Employee Expense Reporting Information System

This is a UML-Based app which allows management for a company to monitor employee transactions made with company-issued cards. Employees will be able to upload photos of their receipts, add information for any missing information, and submit a transaction
to the system. This transaction will then go into pending review that only authorized personnel will be able to approve/deny with reason.

Features:

Dashboard - management will be able to see statistics of their organization's spending and employees will be able to see statistics of their individual spending by category and other useful statistics.
